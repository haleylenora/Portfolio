        <p>A healthy sense of variety controls Haley's work choices, and has made for a pretty trippy story. </p>

        <p>After a period of high School angst, she went to Orange Coast Collage and found the Speech and Debate team. The coaches gave her every event under the sun, and she was best at Parliamentary debate, Persuasion, Prose, Lincoln-Douglas debate, and Poetry in that order. She won a lot, but did not take it too seriously. </p>

        <p>Not being accepted to any state funded schools, she got into Chapman University majoring in Strategic and Corporate Communications. It was pretty fancy, but again she didn't take it too seriously. She found her passion in taking down "the man" by hosting rallies, starting a club, working for the Cross-Cultural Engagement team, and being special elected to the Student Government Association. She won the Woman of Leadership award for her frantically trying to bring awreness to diversity issues. It was important but exhausting. </p>

        <p>The next three years were spent in a sort of deja-vu, recruiting as a staff recruiter, and in-house for some pretty well known companies. It wasn't untill she moved to New Zealand that she was tested to the brim in beauty and isolation. She needed this time to figure out what she wanted, and how to not idealize her place on the planet.</p>

        <p>After a year in NZ, many friends gained, many friends lost, and many questions answered, she headed home ready to gel her life in place. Of course life had other plans.</p>

        <p>It took her longer than necessary to find her passion for design and tech stuff. She has an idea she is sitting on, but wants to organically develop herself so that she can create a future she wants to live in. She is hungry, eager, reletively stable, and supported to go into the future with open arms. California is not New Zealand, but as the world gets smaller, so does the reach of her dreams.</p>
